== Example Usage

.minimal
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank('Label1', 'TYPE1') YIELD computeMillis
CALL algo.pageRankStream('Label1', 'TYPE1') YIELD node, score

== Syntax

.running algorithm and writing back results
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRank(label:String, relationship:String, {iterations:5, dampingFactor:0.85, write: true, scoreProperty:'score'}) YIELD nodes, iterations, loadMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis, dampingFactor, write, property - calculates page rank and potentially writes back
----

.parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| name | type | default | optional | description
| label  | string | null | yes | label to load from the graph, if null load all nodes
| relationship | string | null | yes | relationship-type to load from the graph, if null load all nodes
| iterations | int | 5 | yes | how many iterations of page-rank to run
| dampingFactor | float | 0.85 | yes | damping factor of the page-rank caculation
| write | boolean | true | yes | if result should be written back as node property
| scoreProperty | string | 'score' | yes | property name written back to

.running algorithm and streaming results
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.pageRankStream(label:String, relationship:String, {iterations:20, dampingFactor:0.85}) YIELD node, score - calculates page rank and streams results

## Progress

- [x] single threaded implementation
- [x] tests
- [x] simple benchmark
- [ ] implement procedure
- [x] benchmark on bigger graphs
- [ ] parallelization
- [ ] evaluation

## Requirements

- NodeIterator
- Incoming Relationships
- Outgoing Degrees

## Data structured involved

Our current approach needs one double array for storing ranks.

## ToDo

### parallelization

One approach to parallelize _PageRank_ might be to partition the node into batches - one for each thread. Nonetheless we may need to sync them at the end of each iteration.

### evaluation

- Performance tests on different dataset sizes / level of concurrency

## Future Improvements

- we might scale up the ranks to ints for faster multiplication.
