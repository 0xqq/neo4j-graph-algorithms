.The following will create a sample graph:

include::scripts/triangle-count.cypher[tag=create-sample-graph]

// tag::function[]
.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| nodeA   | nodeB   | nodeC
| Will    | Michael | Chris
| Will    | Mark    | Michael
| Michael | Karin   | Chris
|===
// end::function[]


.The following will return a stream of triples, with `nodeId` for each triangle:
[source, cypher]

include::scripts/triangle-count.cypher[tag=stream-triples]

// tag::stream-triples-result[]
.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1"]

| nodeA   | nodeB   | nodeC
| Will    | Michael | Chris
| Will    | Mark    | Michael
| Michael | Karin   | Chris

// end::stream-triples-result[]

// tag::stream-triples-explanation[]
We can see that there are `KNOWS` triangles containing "Will, Michael, and Chris", "Will, Mark, and Michael", and "Michael, Karin, and Chris".
This means that everybody in the triangle knows each other.

.The following will count the number of triangles that a node is member of, and write it back. It will return the total triangle count and average clustering coefficient of the given graph:

.The following will count the number of triangles that a node is member of, and return a stream with `nodeId` and `triangleCount`:

We learn that Michael is part of the most triangles, but it's Karin and Mark who are the best at introducing their friends - all of the people who know them, know each other!
